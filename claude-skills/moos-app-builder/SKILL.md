# MOOS App Builder

## Overview

Use this skill for user application development against the local MOOS-IvP checkout. Treat MOOS-IvP itself as the dependency and example source unless the user explicitly asks to patch core MOOS-IvP.

## MOOS-IvP Checkout Resolution

When this skill needs a local MOOS-IvP checkout, resolve it in this order:

1. Path explicitly provided by the user.
2. `MOOS_IVP_ROOT` from the shell environment.
3. Active task workspace if it contains `ivp/src`.
4. Parent or sibling directories near the active task workspace.
5. Common home locations such as `~/moos-ivp`, `~/src/moos-ivp`, `~/repos/moos-ivp`, and `~/projects/moos-ivp`.
6. A bounded shallow home search for a directory named `moos-ivp`, excluding noisy folders.

Validate a candidate by confirming `ivp/src` exists and `scripts/GenMOOSApp_AppCasting` is executable.

If no valid checkout is found and the task requires app source generation, build wiring, examples, headers, or libraries, stop and ask the user for the checkout path before editing code, generating build files, or using placeholder paths.

## Core Rules

- Use `GenMOOSApp_AppCasting` for new apps.
- If the project has `src/CMakeLists.txt`, update it with `ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(<app-dir>)`.
- If the project has no build skeleton, create the smallest project-level CMake needed for the new app and point it at the resolved `MOOS_IVP_ROOT`.
- Keep MOOS communication boundaries clear: `OnNewMail()` ingests mail, validates messages, and updates state through `handleMail*` helpers; `Iterate()` owns most business logic, recurring work, and state-derived publications.
- Keep config parsing in `OnStartUp()`, using `handleConfig*` helpers for nontrivial values and AppCasting warnings for bad or unhandled config.
- Keep subscriptions centralized in `registerVariables()` and call `AppCastingMOOSApp::RegisterVariables()` in AppCasting apps.
- Update `_Info.cpp` as part of the app implementation: synopsis, example config, subscriptions, publications, and options must describe the real app.
- Preserve the generator-style metadata comment box at the top of source files and update `NAME`, `ORGN`, `FILE`, and `DATE` to match the user project.
- Use short comments before non-obvious logic blocks; do not add comments that merely restate simple code.
- Reuse existing MOOS-IvP libraries and helpers before writing new parsing, geometry, contact, logic, or AppCasting support code.
- Use local style: MOOS variables are usually uppercase with underscores; mission config params are usually lowercase snake case; C++ members use `m_`; helpers commonly use `handleMail*`, `handleConfig*`, `post*`, `update*`.
- Build and run `--help`, `--example`, and `--interface` as binary smoke checks
  before finishing when feasible. These prove the app starts and its
  self-documentation is wired; they do not prove mission runtime config.
- Do not commit or present build directories/binaries as source changes unless the user's project already tracks generated artifacts.

## Workflow

1. Identify the app role and prefix.
   - `p`: process/control/monitoring app
   - `u`: utility or simulation-support app
   - `uFld`: shoreside field app
   - `i`: interface/driver app
   - If the user did not specify a prefix, use `p` for process/control/monitoring apps and `u` for utilities or simulation helpers.
2. Generate the starting point.
   - New app: run `$MOOS_IVP_ROOT/scripts/GenMOOSApp_AppCasting <Name> <prefix> "<Author>"` from the project source directory.
   - Inspect existing apps as references. Copy an existing app when the user explicitly asks or when it is obviously the nearest local-project base.
3. Wire the build.
   - Read `references/app-build.md` before creating or repairing project-level CMake.
   - Preserve existing project CMake style when present.
4. Implement app behavior.
   - Read `references/app-patterns.md` for mail/config/iterate/AppCasting conventions.
   - Store the latest relevant mail in state; keep expensive, repeated, or state-combining work in `Iterate()`. Publish directly from `OnNewMail()` only for trivial acknowledgments or explicitly requested immediate reactions.
   - Validate message type before using `GetDouble()` or `GetString()`.
5. Update user-facing app metadata.
   - `showSynopsis()`
   - `showExampleConfigAndExit()`
   - `showInterfaceAndExit()`
6. Add or update mission config only if the task needs a runnable mission. Use
   `moos-ivp-mission-builder` for broader launcher, ANTLER, vehicle, or
   shoreside mission work.
   - Use `ProcessConfig = <AppName>` with realistic `AppTick` and `CommsTick`.
   - If only source was requested, an example `ProcessConfig` in `_Info.cpp` is
     enough. If a runnable sample mission was requested, include the
     `ProcessConfig` and the `pAntler` or launcher context that actually starts
     the app.
   - Add the app to `pAntler` or the mission launcher pattern only if the existing mission uses that style.
   - Ensure the launcher can find the built app binary. For external projects,
     prefer a minimal `pAntler` validation mission with a launcher-local
     `PATH=<project>/bin:$PATH` extension, or document the persistent shell
     setup that puts the project `bin/` on `PATH`.
7. Validate.
   - Configure/build the project or target when feasible.
   - Run the generated binary with `--help`, `--example`, and `--interface` as
     smoke checks when those options are supported.
   - If runtime config matters, validate through a normal `pAntler` launch with
     `ProcessConfig = <AppName>` rather than treating a direct binary run as
     equivalent.
   - If a mission was touched, launch only when the user asked for runtime validation or the change is risky enough to justify it.

## Reference Use

- Read `references/app-build.md` when the project build layout is missing, broken, or unfamiliar.
- Read `references/app-patterns.md` before implementing nontrivial app logic.
- Read `references/app-examples.md` when choosing a representative app to inspect in the resolved `MOOS_IVP_ROOT`.

## Validation Checklist

- App has a project build entry.
- App links only the libraries it actually needs, plus `apputil` for AppCasting and `mbutil` for common utilities.
- `OnNewMail()` handles or deliberately ignores subscribed mail without warning on `APPCAST_REQ`.
- `registerVariables()` lists every subscribed variable.
- `showInterfaceAndExit()` matches actual subscriptions/publications.
- Build succeeds, or the blocker is reported with the exact missing dependency/error.
- `--help`, `--example`, and `--interface` reflect the real app and do not
  crash when supported.
- Runtime config, when relevant, is verified through `pAntler` with
  `ProcessConfig = <AppName>`, not by direct app-by-path execution alone.
