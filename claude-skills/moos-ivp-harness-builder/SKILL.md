# MOOS-IvP Harness Builder

## Overview

Use this skill for a harness that runs one or more self-evaluating stem missions
across multiple named cases. The stem mission should own the mission grade. The
harness should own case selection, patching, temp copies, port isolation,
execution waves, cleanup, and direct publication of per-case result rows.

For the stem mission itself, use `moos-ivp-eval-mission-builder`. For ordinary
mission construction before evaluation plumbing, use `moos-ivp-mission-builder`.
For post-run `.alog` evidence, use `moos-alog-analysis`.

## Core Rules

- Start from a stem mission that runs headlessly and writes `results.txt` with a
  `grade=` column.
- Prefer placing harness directories at the repository root, alongside
  `missions/`, for example `harnesses/<harness_name>/` paired with
  `missions/<stem_mission>/`. In larger repositories, use optional family
  grouping for both sides, such as
  `harnesses/<family>_harnesses/HNN-<harness_name>/` paired with
  `missions/<family>_missions/<stem_mission>/`. Have the harness refer to stem
  missions with explicit relative paths. Other layouts are acceptable when
  project conventions or packaging require them.
- The stem mission must be a real eval mission: `pMissionEval` writes the
  `grade=` row. Do not accept a stem where `zlaunch.sh` or shell code
  synthesizes `grade=` from target files, patch markers, or harness knowledge.
- Keep case intent documented in the harness README under `Cases` or
  `Current Matrix`.
- Use exact case tokens in documentation and in `zlaunch.sh`.
- Keep patch selection explicit. A shell `case` block mapping case name to
  patch files and intent is easier to audit than filename inference.
- Prefer `nspatch` sidecar overlays for small variants that share one stem.
- Keep `launch.sh` and stem wrappers human-facing. Put loops, temp copies,
  aggregation, and archives in harness code.
- Prefer mission-owned grades. The harness should normally prepend
  `case=<case_name>` to the mission result row and preserve the mission's
  `grade=pass|fail` as the case verdict.
- For expected-negative cases, make the stem `pMissionEval` pass when the
  expected negative evidence is observed. Do not encode those cases as
  `expected=fail actual=fail` unless the harness is explicitly testing failure
  machinery such as `pMissionEval`, `uMayFinish`, or CLI return semantics.
- Harness code should synthesize its own `grade=fail` rows only for runner
  failures, such as `reason=launch_error`, `reason=missing_result`,
  `reason=prepare_error`, or `reason=missing_result_file`.
- Do not add a harness-owned `reason=` for ordinary `pMissionEval` failures.
  Preserve the mission evidence columns that explain the failure. A mission may
  report its own compact `reason=`, but the harness should not reinterpret it.
- Avoid new `case_result=success|mismatch|error` result formats for ordinary
  harnesses. Treat them as legacy compatibility or as a special pattern for
  tests whose subject is the failure machinery itself.
- Keep evaluation levels strict: app-level harnesses should grade the app under
  test; moving/integration harnesses may grade arrival, encounter outcome,
  collision state, or other mission outcomes.
- Expose `--case`, `--port_base`, `--keep_workdirs`, `--gui`, `--nogui`, and
  `--max_time` when the harness can support them. Expose `--jobs` only when it
  runs real grouped waves with backgrounded cases and a `wait` barrier; serial
  harnesses should omit `--jobs`.
- Treat harness `--max_time` as a run-time ceiling override forwarded to each
  stem eval mission's `zlaunch.sh`; do not use it as harness-side grading
  logic.
- Default generated harnesses to `PORT_BASE=9000`. Use higher fresh bases only
  as explicit run-time overrides for automation or local sessions that may
  collide with ordinary missions in the `9000` range.
- Use headless mode as the grouped-run default. Keep `--gui` available for an
  individual case when visual inspection is useful.
- For wave execution, give each live case its own temp mission copy and port
  block.
- Create per-case temp mission copies under a harness-owned run root, not a
  generic system temp location. `--keep_workdirs` should preserve one auditable
  run tree beneath the harness directory.
- Use scoped teardown between cases, between waves, and at harness exit. Prefer
  copying `assets/moos_scoped_teardown.sh` into the generated project as
  `<project-root>/scripts/moos_scoped_teardown.sh`, sourcing it from harness
  launchers, and calling `moos_scoped_teardown_stop_root` on the harness-owned
  run root or case directory. Do not use global `ktm`, `pkill`, or machine-wide
  cleanup as the normal path.
- If a case is timing-sensitive only when grouped, document it as a solo-wave
  case instead of disabling all parallelism.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the stem mission passes as a single eval mission.
   - run the eval mission static checker against the stem
   - `launch.sh` accepts and forwards `--shore_mport`, `--veh_mport`,
     `--shore_pshare`, `--veh_pshare`, and `--mmod`.
   - launchers use `nsplug -x` so `.moosx` and `.bhvx` sidecars are consumed.
   - generated targets prove the forwarded ports and patches actually landed.
2. Define case tokens, case intent, and the mission-owned evidence each case
   should report.
3. Document the case matrix in `README.md`.
4. Decide whether each case needs sidecar patches, launch arguments, fixture
   files, or no mutation.
5. Build `zlaunch.sh` around:
   - argument parsing
   - `get_case_config`
   - optional `apply_case_patches`
   - `run_case`
   - serial and wave execution
   - result aggregation
   - cleanup traps
6. Add the teardown helper asset to the generated project if there is not
   already an equivalent root-scoped helper.
7. Implement port forwarding from harness to stem mission and verify generated
   targets reflect those ports.
8. Add `--keep_workdirs` for debugging preserved temp copies.
9. Validate one case, all serial cases, then a small wave run on a fresh
   `--port_base`.

## Reference Use

- Read `references/harness-style.md` for the overall architecture.
- Read `references/case-matrix.md` before writing README case docs.
- Read `references/nspatch-workflow.md` before adding patch overlays.
- Read `references/ports-and-parallelism.md` before implementing `--jobs` or
  `--port_base`.
- Read `references/generated-harness-self-tests.md` before reporting a new or
  heavily changed harness as trustworthy.
- Read `references/validation.md` before reporting a harness as done.
- Read `references/timing-and-benchmarking.md` before tuning `--jobs`, sleeps,
  `--max_time`, or benchmarking grouped runs.
- Read `references/scoped-teardown.md` before writing cleanup logic.
- Read `references/example-harness-zlaunch.md` for a compact runner skeleton.
- Reuse `assets/moos_scoped_teardown.sh` by copying it into generated harness
  projects as `<project-root>/scripts/moos_scoped_teardown.sh` when they do not
  already provide an equivalent root-scoped helper.
- Run `scripts/static_check_harness.sh <harness-dir>` for a structural check.

## Validation Checklist

- Stem mission passes alone with `./zlaunch.sh --max_time=<secs>`.
- Stem mission passes `moos-ivp-eval-mission-builder` static validation; the
  harness static checker alone is not enough.
- Harness README has a `Cases` or `Current Matrix` section with exact case
  tokens and prose intent.
- `./zlaunch.sh --case=<case> --max_time=<secs>` works for at least one nominal
  case and one expected-negative case if the suite has both.
- If `--jobs` is exposed, `./zlaunch.sh --jobs=1 --port_base=<base>` works, and
  a grouped run with `--jobs=2` or higher uses distinct temp directories and
  distinct port blocks.
- Aggregated results include `case=` and the mission's original result columns,
  especially `grade=` and useful evidence fields such as `eval=`,
  `warning_count=`, `expected=`, `observed=`, or case-specific scalars.
- `form=`, `mmod=`, and `mhash=` are optional provenance. `case=` is the
  harness row key. `mmod=` is the stem mission's own variation label. They may
  match when each harness case maps one-to-one to a stem variation, but do not
  force them to match when the harness case represents runner behavior, timing,
  expected failure machinery, or multiple cases over the same mission variant.
- Ordinary case success is `grade=pass`. Any row with `grade!=pass` should make
  the harness exit nonzero unless the harness is explicitly testing failure
  machinery.
- Harness-owned failure rows use `case=<case> grade=fail reason=<runner_reason>`
  and preserve launch return codes or setup evidence when available.
- Selected runs produce one normalized result line for every selected case,
  including setup errors and intentional failures.
- A selected run that produces zero case rows is a harness failure and should
  exit nonzero with a clear diagnostic. This catches portability bugs where the
  case loop never actually ran.
- Keep harness shell code portable to macOS system Bash. Avoid `mapfile`,
  `readarray`, associative arrays, and other Bash 4+ conveniences unless the
  project explicitly controls the shell runtime.
- `--keep_workdirs` preserves enough files to inspect generated targets and
  `results.txt`.
- Preserved workdirs show generated targets using distinct forwarded ports and
  any intended `.moosx` / `.bhvx` sidecars.
- No harness path relies on global `ktm`, `pkill`, or `killall`.
- Harness cleanup uses a root-scoped teardown helper or an equivalent recorded
  PID cleanup path; generated harnesses should not invent broad process cleanup.
- Logs do not contain unexpected warnings hidden by case aggregation.
