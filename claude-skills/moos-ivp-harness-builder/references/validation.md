# Harness Validation

Validate from smallest to largest.

For new or heavily changed harnesses, also run the adversarial checks in
`generated-harness-self-tests.md`.

## Stem First

```bash
cd <stem-mission>
<skills-root>/moos-ivp-eval-mission-builder/scripts/static_check_eval_mission.sh .
./zlaunch.sh --max_time=90 10
```

Do not debug the harness until the stem writes the expected `results.txt`.
Confirm that `pMissionEval`, not shell wrapper code, writes the `grade=` row.
The stem's `zlaunch.sh` may check for a missing grade, but it must not echo or
derive the final grade itself.

Also verify the stem contract:

```bash
./zlaunch.sh --just_make --shore_mport=9000 --veh_mport=9001 \
  --shore_pshare=9015 --veh_pshare=9016 --mmod=contract_check 10
```

Inspect generated targets for those ports and inspect launchers for `nsplug -x`
support before adding harness patches.

## One Case

```bash
cd <harness>
./zlaunch.sh --case=<case-token> --max_time=90
```

Confirm the harness output includes:

- case token
- mission grade
- `eval=` or other mission-owned verdict evidence when available
- runner-failure `reason=` if the mission did not produce a usable result
- original mission result columns

## Serial Suite

```bash
./zlaunch.sh --port_base=9000
```

Serial mode should not depend on default ports. If the harness exposes
`--jobs`, also run a single-wave check such as `--jobs=1` and at least one
grouped run such as `--jobs=2`; serial-only harnesses should omit `--jobs`.

Before trusting results, reconcile README case tokens with the script's
`CASES` / `ALL_CASES` list and `get_case_config`.

## Small Wave

```bash
./zlaunch.sh --jobs=2 --port_base=9600 --keep_workdirs
```

Inspect preserved workdirs to confirm each case has generated targets with
distinct MOOSDB and pShare ports.

Preserved workdirs should be under one harness-owned run root, not scattered in
system temp directories.

After the grouped run exits, actively check the forwarded MOOSDB and pShare
ports from each case block for remaining listeners. Static checks can reject
broad cleanup patterns, but they cannot prove that the generated stem actually
stopped every launched process.

For generated harnesses, verify `<project-root>/scripts/moos_scoped_teardown.sh`
exists, is executable, and is sourced by the harness launcher unless the project
already has an equivalent root-scoped helper. The helper is a cleanup backstop;
it should not replace normal mission completion through the stem `zlaunch.sh` /
`xlaunch.sh` path.

A one-case debug run may bypass the isolated temp-copy path in some harness
styles. Use a grouped run with preserved workdirs when validating port
isolation, sidecar consumption, or wave cleanup.

## Post-Run Hygiene

After serial and wave runs, check:

- generated targets consumed forwarded ports
- expected `.moosx` and `.bhvx` sidecars exist only in the intended workdirs
- no mission-owned MOOSDB, pShare, app, or viewer processes remain
- logs do not contain unexpected warnings that the mission grade masks
- no other harness batch is using an overlapping port range
- runtime summaries distinguish wall-clock time from MOOS time when reporting
  timing or benchmark results

Use `moos-alog-analysis` for targeted post-run evidence when aggregated case
results are not enough to diagnose a failure.

For ordinary harnesses, every selected case should produce exactly one row with
`case=` and `grade=`. Treat `grade=pass` as the case passing. Treat any other
grade as suite failure unless the harness is explicitly testing failure
machinery. Do not require `expected=`, `actual=`, or `case_result=` in new
harness output.

## Failure Debugging

If a wave-only failure occurs:

1. Preserve workdirs.
2. Inspect each case's `results.txt`.
3. Inspect generated `targ_*.moos` ports.
4. Run the failing case alone on a fresh `--port_base`.
5. Add a solo-wave exception only when the case is truly timing-sensitive.
